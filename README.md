# Portfolio For Interactive Data Visualization Spring 2021
This page contains my narrative and exploratory projects for my spring 2021 class at the CUNY Graduate Center 

## Projects
The exploratory project contains data that maps out how much the NYPD costs the city from settlement payouts and how it adversely affects the New York taxpayer. The narrative project 
contains visualizations from my personal Spotify listening history that spans a year. Since the pandemic started, I noticed that I have been listening to more music in my free time and 
the visualizations will help me see if there have been any changes or patterns that may surprise me.
