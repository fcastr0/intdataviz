      <h2>Tracking My Spotify Listening History</h2> 
      <h4><i>Freddy Castro</i></h4>

    <div class="intro">
      <p>Listening to music may be one of my favorite pass times, I listen to songs when I am running errands, riding my bike, and working on my assignments for school. 
       Since the start of the pandemic, I noticed that I started to listen to more and more music since New Yorkers had to remain at home to self-quarantine because of the coronavirus 
       pandemic that affected the United States on March 2020. I noticed that I would occasionally leave Spotify open and have it serve as background noise while reading or working out in my room. 
       The following data was obtained through Spotify’s data request tool, which you may request as well under their “privacy” menu option. 
      </p>
      <p>The data spans a years’ worth of listening and 
       in my particular case spans from April 2020 to April 2021 and contains information such as milliseconds spent listening to songs, your advertisement preferences, search queries, 
       playlist information, who you follow and who follows you, and much more. The data collected contains the time the pandemic started and will help me visualize which artists I listened
       to the most in one year and which days I would listen to the most music. I also included a personal rating number to each artist so that I may map out which artists stand out from 
       the rest when I take into consideration their ranking and hours spent listening to said artist/band. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The following scatter plot is a collection of all the artists I have listened to from April of 2020 to April 2021 and plots the individual artist/band against my personal 
        rating which spans from 1 to 10. Feel free to hover over a point to get an in depth view.
        Below is the definition for each rating:
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="ranking">
      <ul>
        <li><b>1-3:</b> Artists in this category are ones that I have no emotional connection with and are usually bands that I listen to check to see if I would enjoy them. 
          They are usually bands that pop up in Spotify’s “Discover Weekly” playlist.
        </li>
        <li><b>3-5:</b> Bands placed here are bands that I would occasionally listen to on a whim but again they hold no emotional connection either. I would consider artists 
          located here as ones that I know of but do not know their entire discography.
        </li>
        <li><b>6-8:</b> Artists/bands in this section are ones that I do hold some emotional connection with and would listen to them at least a few times a week. I know their 
          albums and the name of the artists.
        </li>
        <li><b>9-10:</b> Artists in this category are some of my favorite and I would listen to them on a daily basis, or at least more than a few times a week.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    </div>

    <div class="scatterexplanation">
      <p>I noticed that there is a big cluster of bands appearing between the 6 and 8 rating, which is expected since bands in this category are ones that I listen to on 
      a nearly daily basis. There is also a big cluster between the 2 to 4 rating as well but they are a bit difficult to distinguish since I listen to the bands in these 
      category far less than my top rated bands.

        The next visualization is a treemap exploring which days I spent the most time listening to music:

      <p>
        I found it very surprising that it was in fact Thursdays and Fridays where I spent the most hours listening to music 
        because my initial prediction was that it was going to be Saturday and Sunday. As I reflect now, it does make sense for Thursday and Friday to be the 
        days I listen to the most music since this is when I did not have class and did the bulk of my schoolwork. Spotify also updates their “Release Radar” which is 
        a playlist that is curated based on your listening habits and is updated with new releases by artists and bands you may know.  Saturdays and Sundays were 
        usually spent being outside with friends or being occupied with other errands that required me to stay focused.

        The following bar chart shows my top 20 artists in the last year based on the amount of hours spent listening to them:

        I was genuinely surprised to see JPEGMAFIA take the lead by a big margin over the next top two played artists. I do remember listening to him when 
        I was working out at home or going out for a bike ride almost every time.  
      </p>

        This project definitely helped me better understand my listening habits and I found some bits of information surprising especially when it came 
        down to which days I spent the most time listening to music. I hope this project encourages others to do the same, perhaps not with music but any other 
        form of media that is easy to compile and visualize.
