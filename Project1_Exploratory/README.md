## Exploratory Project
 
For the exploratory project I will be working with NYC police settlement data and map the number of complaints from 2010 to 2019. I will incorporate line graphs, bar charts, and perhaps a map of NYC to help locate which areas/precincts had the most cumulative complaints. Sketch of what's to come is [here](https://excalidraw.com/#room=94f1b7be35b41ceb2877,jUU-p_QIYB7y_jh_IqUyRA)
